# Redux Toolkit Generic Slice Library

A generic utility to easily create Redux slices with Redux Toolkit using TypeScript, enabling quick and reusable state management without the repetitive boilerplate code.

## Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed, offering a great developer experience.
- **Simplifies Boilerplate**: Reduces repetitive code required to manage state using Redux Toolkit.
- **Generic Solution**: Flexible and reusable, allowing you to quickly generate Redux slices for multiple entities.

## Installation

To use this library in your project, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install redux-toolkit-generics
```

If you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add redux-toolkit-generics
```

## Getting Started

The library provides a generic function, `createGenericSlice`, that helps you create Redux slices with minimal boilerplate.

### Usage

1. Import the `createGenericSlice` function from the library.
2. Pass in the entity name and a function for fetching data.

## API

### `createGenericSlice<T>(name: string, fetchFunction: () => Promise<T[]>): { reducer, actions }`

- **`name`**: The name of the slice (string).
- **`fetchFunction`**: An async function that returns an array of items (`T[]`) to populate your state.

### Returns

- **`reducer`**: The reducer function to be added to your store.
- **`actions`**: An object containing the actions generated for the slice, including the async thunk.

## Examples

### Creating a User Slice

```typescript
import { createGenericSlice } from 'redux-toolkit-generics';

// Define a function to fetch user data
const fetchUsers = async () => {
  return await fetch('/api/users').then((res) => res.json());
};

// Create a user slice
export const userSlice = createGenericSlice('user', fetchUsers);

// Export the reducer and actions
export const userReducer = userSlice.reducer;
export const userActions = userSlice.actions;
```

### Creating a Post Slice

```typescript
import { createGenericSlice } from 'redux-toolkit-generics';

// Define a function to fetch post data
const fetchPosts = async () => {
  return await fetch('/api/posts').then((res) => res.json());
};

// Create a post slice
export const postSlice = createGenericSlice('post', fetchPosts);

// Export the reducer and actions
export const postReducer = postSlice.reducer;
export const postActions = postSlice.actions;
```

## Setup with Redux Store

After creating the slice, you need to add the reducer to your store:

```typescript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { userReducer } from './userSlice';
import { postReducer } from './postSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    users: userReducer,
    posts: postReducer,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

## Contributing

### Additional Tips for Your README

- **Badges**: Add badges at the top for things like NPM version, build status, license, etc. Example badges can be found on [shields.io](https://shields.io/).
- **GitHub Link**: Update the GitHub link to point to your repository.
- **Examples**: Provide as many examples as possible to help developers quickly understand how to use your library. Real-world use cases or demo projects are helpful.
- **Versioning and Changes**: Include a "Changelog" section if you anticipate frequent updates. This helps users understand what has changed between versions.
- **Code Snippets**: Use TypeScript syntax highlighting (```typescript) for better readability.
- **Screenshots**: You can add screenshots or even GIFs if your library involves a UI, to give users a clear visual idea of the features.

With this README, users will understand what your library does, how to install it, and how to use it efficiently. If you need further customizations or want to add more content, feel free to ask!
